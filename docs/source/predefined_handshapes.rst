.. _Select_handshape:

1. Selecting a predefined handshape
`````````````````
To select a predefined handshape click on the hand icon on the menu bar at the top left. A new window will open. The predefined handshapes are organized vertically by base handshape and horizontally by modification type. For example, if you are searching for 'clawed-F', you can find if in the 'F' row and the 'clawed' column.

The configuration and hand for which you are selecting the handshape will default to the one that is selected in the 'handshape transcription' window, but it can be changed on the top bar of the predefined handshapes window. For example, if you want to select a predefined handshape for
Configuration 1 of Hand 2, select the option 'Config1 Hand2' and then select the handshape.

Once you have selected a predefined handshape, the transcription will be filled in to the slots of the appropriate configuration and hand on the 'handshape transcription' window. The name and image of the selected handshape will appear to the right of the slots. To clear this selection, click on the 'clear' button to the right of the predefined handshape name. To change the selection, you can simply select another predefined handshape to replace it (while the configuration and hand you are trying to change is still selected). 


.. _make_changes:

2. Making specific changes
`````````````````
Once a predefined handshape has been selected, you can change individual slots of the predefined handshape transcription by clicking on a slot and either selecting an option from the dropdown menu or typing in the appropriate symbol. Once changes are made, the name and image of the predefined handshape will no longer appear to the right of the transcription. For more detailed axplanation of the transcription process, see 'transcription_process.rtf')


.. _handshape_conventions:

3. Conventions for how Pre-defined Handshapes were Coded
`````````````````
General Conventions
===================

Base >> derived principle 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * For baseline handshapes, pictures and transcriptions should be an exact match.
  * For derived handshapes, the transcriptions will match the conventions below, even if that means the picture isn’t an exact match. For example, the convention for thumb abduction for all “extended” handshapes is to have it be fully abducted ({). However, the image for “clawed-extended-L” shows a laterally positioned (L) thumb that is not fully abducted. The image shows what would have been transcribed as a neutral (<) abduction value, but the transcription uses { as the conventions dictate. This discrepancy between images and transcriptions is simply an artifact of the images we had available.

- Using only F, E, i not f, e
  - [F] was used for a fully bent joint, [i] was used to achieve a slightly bent joint, and [E] was used for a straight extended joint. [f] and [e] were avoided. 
[i-i-i] was used when the finger was meant to look rounded (i.e. “O” handshape)

- Conventions used for labels where multiple derivations from the baseline are involved:
Handshapes are sorted based on the first listed derivation in the label.
The following order was generally followed for consistency: [derivations involving the fingers (flexion, adduction), involving thumb, “combined”, base(s), “index”] 
“Offset” is considered a derivation involving the thumb
Derivations “modified”, “closed” and “open” are positioned fitting to the order in which they apply to the base relative to the other derivation. For example: for “spread-open-O” the modification “open” applies before the modification “spread”; for “open-O-index”, “open” must go before “index” because “O-index” is essentially the handshape that is being modified.

- Labels for combined handshapes: 
All combined handshapes that have been coded involve at least one of either “I” or “Y” and have therefore been listed under one of those baseline handshapes as opposed to any other handshape they may be combined with. 

- Finger tuckedness 
For consistency within a particular handshape group (a baseline handshape and its derivations) a somewhat arbitrary decision was made for certain handshapes that have multiple documented possibilities for finger tuckedness (e.g. L handshapes with fingers 3,4,5 flexion as F-F-F, with the non-selected fingers ‘tucked under,’ vs. with F-F-E, with the non-selected fingers in a fist shape but the distal joints ‘untucked’). 
In some cases, this decision was based on the available images of the handshape.
Note that searches for these handshapes may include finger flexion values of F-F-F and F-F-E for a broader range of instances of the handshape, or be narrowed down to one or the other for more specific instances of a particular configuration.
Note the exception of baseline “A” and “modified-A”, whose only distinction is the tuckedness of the fingers.

- ‘Upright’ for Y-derived handshapes:
For consistency with baseline “Y”, which is coded with a neutral abduction (<) of finger 4, Y-derived handshapes (e.g. combined-ILY & combined-Y+U) maintain this abduction value for finger 4. 

- Criteria for adduction:
The criteria for full adduction (=) are slightly different for fingers 1-3 as compared to finger 4, with finger 4 being less strict. 
For fingers 1-3, they are coded as adducted (=) if they are touching or if they are slightly apart but still parallel. 
For finger 4, it is coded as adducted (=) if it is touching the side of finger 3 or the space between finger 3 & 4 at the distal bone of finger 4 is equal to or smaller than the width of the distal bone of finger 4. 

- Adduction/abduction of bent handshapes: 
For certain handshapes with extended fingers (e.g. “L”, "V" & "U") which are coded with neutral abduction (<) between the extended (E) finger(s) and flexed (F) fingers, their “bent” counterparts (i.e. "bent-L", "bent-V" & "bent-U") are coded with full adduction (=) between these same fingers due to all proximal joints being flexed (F). 

- Naming of handshapes:
Names for handshapes typically follow the names given by The Canadian Dictionary of ASL. In some cases, there are other possible names for a given handshape that we did not use, even if there are more concise possibilities (e.g. the handshape "bent-extended-V"could have alternatively been labeled "bent-3").

.. _copy_and_paste:


4. Copying and Pasting
`````````````````
Using the Copy and Paste functions, you can copy your transcription for one Config and paste it to to 
another Config within the same sign.

To copy your transcription, click on the "Copy" button at the top right corner or go to "Edit" in the menu bar and 
select "Copy a transcription...". A new window "Copy transcription" will appear. Select a Config that you would like to copy, 
and click "OK".

Similarly, to paste the transcription, click on the "Paste" button at the top right corner or go to "Edit" in the menu bar and 
select "Paste a transcription...". A new window "Paste transcription" will appear. Make sure that the intended trasnscription 
has been copied, and select a Config to which you would like to paste that transcription. If you would like to paste 
only the symbols and not the flags, then uncheck the option "Paste in highlighting for uncertain and estimated slots". 
Click "OK". 
Note that any existing symbols in the Config will be overwritten.

   For example, let's say you would like to copy your transcription for Config 1 of Hand 1 and paste it to Config 1 of Hand 2.
   
   
   First, click on the Copy button. In the new window, select Config 1, Hand 1, and click OK.

      :align: center

  
   Second, click on the Paste button. In the new window, you can see the copied transcription in the first line, 
   introduced by    "The currently copied transcription is". Make sure that it is the correct one. 
   Then select "Config 1, Hand 2", and click "OK".

   This function may be particularly useful for transcribing symmetrical signs or assymmetrical signs in which
   only the dominant hand changes its handshape.

.. _check_global_handshape:

5. Checking Global handshape options
`````````````````
Global handshape options (see :ref:`global_handshape_options`) can be checked by simply cliking the box next to a description.
The options "Estimated" and "Uncertain" can be thought of as a global counterpart of the slot options "Flag as estimate" 
and "Flag as uncertain," respectively (see :ref:`flag_slot`).
In other words, it may be useful, for example, to check these Global handshape options when estimation or uncertainty applies
to a whole sign or a whole field(s) rather than individual slots.


.. _other_parameters:

6. Transcribing other parameters
`````````````````
To transcribe parameters other than handshapes, click on "View Parameters" button at the top right corner. A new window will
appear, and you can select relevant values. To transcribe handshapes and parameters at the same time, see :ref:`options`.

.. _add_sign_notes:

7. Adding Sign and Corpus notes
`````````````````
To add a note to a sign that you are transcribing, go to "Notes" in the menu bar and click on "Edit sign notes..." A new 
window will appear, and you can type in your comments. 

.. image:: static/sign_notes.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
        
Sign notes are automatically saved when the signs are saved, and you can go back and edit them by following the above step.
It may be useful, for example, to use this sign notes to describe reasons for checking the Global handshape options.    

Similarly, "Notes" > "Edit corpus notes..." will allow you to add a note to the entire corpus.


.. _check_transcription:

8. Checking transcription
`````````````````
To check your transcription against your selected constraints (see :ref:`constraints`), click on "Check transcription" button.


.. _visualize_transcription:

9. Visualizing transcription
`````````````````
To see a graphic image of transcribed handshapes, click on "Visualize transcription" button. A new window titled 
"Handshape visualization" appears. Select a combination of Config and Hand you would like to visualize, and click "OK".

.. _save_sign:

10. Saving a sign to a corpus
`````````````````
Note that each sign should be saved before a next sign can be transcribed. To save a sign, either click on "Save word to
corpus" button or go to "File" in the menu bar and select "Save current word". You will get a message 
"Corpus successfully updated!" if "Show save alert" is selected in your setting (see :ref:`options`).


If you do not have a corpus loaded beforehand, you will get a warning message: "You must have a corpus loaded before you can
save words. What woule you like to do?". You can either "Create a new corpus" or "Add this word to an existing corpus".

.. image:: static/corpus_warning.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center


If you have a sign with the same gloss already saved in the same corpus and "Warn about duplicate glosses" is selected in your
setting (see :ref:`options`), you will get a warning message: "A word with the gloss XXX already exists in your corpus. What do you want to do?".
You can either "Go back and edit the gloss" or "Overwrite existing word".

.. image:: static/duplicate_warning.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center


Finally, if you click on "New gloss" (see :ref:`next_sign`) without saving the current sign, you will get a warning message: 
"The current gloss has unsaved changes. what would you like to do?" It gives you options to either "Go back" to the current 
sign or to "Continue without saving". 
If this is the first time the sign is transcribed in the corpus, the latter option will delete a sign.


.. _next_sign:

11. Transcribing the next sign
`````````````````
Once a sign has been saved, if you would like to continue on transcribing a next sign, you can either click on 
the "New gloss" button or go to "File" and select "New gloss".

You can repeat the transcribing process from :ref:`enter_gloss`.
